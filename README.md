Download the files and launch the .sln, then click start in Visual Studio.

The game can be exited by pressing ESC

The game was created before I had any formal education in programming so there probably isnt the best of practices being done.

But the game works, and even features an AI (kinda) opponent at the end level. Not to bad for a first major game!

Enjoy!
